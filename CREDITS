This file should be included in all binary builds.
These projects don't require credit to be given, but I will anyway:

- Ryan C. Gordon's PhysicsFS library is used to support easy asset replacement
  while allowing the executable to be completely portable.
- graphitemaster's incbin library is used to embed assets into the executable
- The GLFW library (with too many contributors to list) is used to handle
  windows and keyboard/mouse/gamepad inputs on all platforms.
- Dav1dde's GLAD library is used to load OpenGL on all platforms
- The "stb" libraries by Sean Barrett, Fabian Giesen, Ryan Gordon, and many
  others are used to rasterize fonts and compress textures.


The following software libraries and assets are embedded in the program and
require a legal licensing disclaimer:
    - cglm linear algebra and 3d math library (https://github.com/recp/cglm)
    - ProFontIIx TrueType font set
